**About me:**

Hello everyone, my name is Aleksandr and I am a novice developer.  
As a student, I received a technical education, but practically did not work in my specialty.  
I think it had to take time for me to understand what I really want to do...  
Today I am back in the IT field, with renewed vigor and a great desire to learn and develop in this direction, already having experience in other areas, for example in trade and sales.

**Skills:**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (basic)
* GIT (GITHUB)
* VSCODE
* WINDOWS
* GNU/LINUX


**Code Example:**

```
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b;
}
```

**Work Experience:**

For many years I have been working in senior positions in trade and sales.

**Education:**

* Technical education (4 years), faculty : Software Developer (end)
* [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2023/spring/) (in progress)
* [RS-SCOOL - JS / FRONT-END. STAGE 0 (RU)](https://rs.school/js-stage0/) (in progress)
